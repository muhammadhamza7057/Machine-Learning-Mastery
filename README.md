# Machine-Learning-Mastery
A structured Machine Learning and programming learning journey, documenting my progress, practice, and experiments in Python, with a foundation in algorithms and data structures learned in C++.

This repository reflects my continuous learning process, starting with Python basics and progressing towards advanced topics, OOP, algorithms, and eventually Machine Learning.

## 📚 What’s Inside

### 1. Python Learning (Basics → OOP)
- Python fundamentals: variables, loops, conditions, functions
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): classes, inheritance, methods
- Practicing syntax, writing small programs, and exploring Pythonic ways
- Exercises to reinforce learning

### 2. Algorithms & Data Structures (DSA)
- Already studied in **C++**
- Will be implemented and practiced in Python gradually
- Covers sorting, searching, recursion, arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming

### 3. Machine Learning (Upcoming)
- Fundamentals and key algorithms
- Hands-on experimentation in Python
- Will be added once Python fundamentals are strong
